Through this project, we will develop an AI system which is a Traffic Sign Recognition Neural Network Model. This model will take images of the traffic symbols and return the recognized labels of that traffic sign. The model will be a Convolutional Neural Network model that is designed and trained totally using Pytorch Library.

Why CNN?
In machine learning, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN or Conv2D) are complex neural networks. CNNs are used for image classification and recognition because of its high accuracy.

Why Pytorch?
PyTorch is an optimized tensor processing library primarily used for Deep Learning applications using GPUs and CPUs. It is an open-source machine learning library for Python. It is one of the widely used Machine learning libraries, like TensorFlow and Keras.
